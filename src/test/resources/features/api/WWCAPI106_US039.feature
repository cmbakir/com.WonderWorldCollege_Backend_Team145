Feature: As an administrator (admin), I want to be able to access the Notice information of the user with the given id via API connection.

  Scenario Outline: Successful Response with Valid Authorization and ID
    * The api user constructs the base url with the "admin" token.
    * The api user sets "api/getNoticeById" path parameters.
    * The api user prepares a POST request to send to the api getNoticeById endpoint containing the information <id>.
    * The api user sends a POST request and saves the returned response.
    * The api user verifies that the status code is 200.
    * The api user verifies that the "message" information in the response body is "Success".
    * The api user verifies that the data in the response body includes "<id>" "<type>" "<slug>", "<url>", "<title>", "<date>", "<event_start>", "<event_end>", "<event_venue>", "<description>", "<is_active>" and "<created_at>".

    Examples:
      | id  | | type  | slug                    | url                         | title                   | date       | event_start | event_end | | event_venue   || description          | | is_active          | | created_at          |
